Proteja is intended to be a comprehensive test suite management tool.  It allows you to collect coverage information at the statement, method, and class levels of
granularity for Java programs.  Proteja also allows you to control the granularity of coverage reporting (e.g., per-test case vs. entire test suite). The format of these coverage reports is a binary matrix that can be used as
input to test suite reduction and prioritization techniques.  Proteja will also accept a file describing the modifications to the test suite in order to run a reduced or prioritized test suite.
